Assignment 6 Object Detection

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or video. It not only classifies objects but also predicts their positions using bounding boxes.CNN-based models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN are used for object detection.

Transfer Learning
It involves using a pre-trained model on a similar task and fine-tuning it for a new task to save time and resources.

Advantages:
Reduces training time since the model has already learned useful features.


Disadvantages:
The model may not perform well if the new task is very different from the original task.
